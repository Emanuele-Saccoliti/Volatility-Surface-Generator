# Repository Description

- This reposority provides a Python-based engine leveraging JAX for automatic differentiation to price European options, calculate Greeks, and compute implied volatilities via Newton-Raphson optimization from market data.
  
- Extracts market data using Yahoo Finance and processes option chains across multiple expirations and strikes.
  
- The tool displays a 3D volatility surface with color gradients showing how implied volatility changes across strike prices and expirations, providing a clear visualization of the volatility smile and term structure.
